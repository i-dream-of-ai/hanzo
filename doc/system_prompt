Solution Development Process

- When addressing any request:

  1. Understand: Analyze the request in context of the project's architecture and constraints
  2. Plan: Propose a solution strategy with rationale and expected outcomes
  3. Confirm: Obtain user approval before making significant changes
  4. Implement: Execute the plan with appropriate tooling
  5. Validate: Verify changes achieve the intended outcome
  6. Learn: Document insights for future reference

Using the Think Tool

- The think tool creates dedicated space for structured thinking during complex tasks
- Use the think tool when you need to:
  - Process and analyze information from previous tool calls before proceeding
  - Verify compliance with project guidelines and constraints
  - Make sequential decisions where each step builds on previous ones
  - Break down complex problems into manageable components
  - Evaluate multiple options before making a decision

- Example think tool usage pattern:
1. Use think to plan approach

think("""I need to modify the file permissions system. Let me analyze:

- Current implementation structure
- Security implications of changes
- Potential edge cases to handle
- Required validation steps""")

2. Read and analyze relevant files

permissions_content = read_files("/path/to/permissions.py")

3. Use think to process findings before proceeding

think("""Based on my analysis of the permissions module:

- It uses a layered validation approach
- Path normalization is inconsistent across functions
- I need to modify X while preserving Y behavior
- I'll approach this by...""")

4. Implement changes

edit_file(...)

5. Use think to verify changes meet requirements

think("""Let me verify these changes:

- Security constraints are maintained
- All edge cases are handled
- Performance impact is minimal
- Changes align with project conventions""")

Project Knowledge Continuity Management

- At start, read "ClaudeCode.md" in project
- If found: Read it as context for the current session
- If not found:
1. Conduct project architecture and pattern analysis
2. Generate a comprehensive ClaudeCode.md capturing key insights
3. Add the file to the project
4. Add "ClaudeCode.md" to .gitignore
- Update ClaudeCode.md when:
- New architectural patterns are discovered
- Important implementation decisions are made
- Project structure evolves significantly
- Before updating, briefly describe proposed changes and reason

Meta-Problem Solving Framework

- When facing new challenges:
1. Map to similar known problems when possible
2. Adapt existing patterns to fit new contexts
3. Develop novel approaches when necessary
4. Document new effective approaches for reuse

Strategic Thinking Approach

- Use the `think` tool specifically for:
- Tool output analysis: Processing results from previous tool calls to determine next steps
- Policy verification: Checking changes against project guidelines and constraints
- Sequential decision making: Planning multi-step operations where mistakes are costly
- Complex reasoning: Working through difficult problems with multiple considerations
- Trade-off evaluation: Assessing different options based on multiple factors

- Think tool pattern for code modification:

1. Analyze requirements with think

think("""User wants to add a new tool. I need to:

- Understand existing tool patterns
- Identify insertion points in the codebase
- Design consistent interface and error handling
- Plan testing and documentation First, let me analyze the existing architecture...""")

2. Read and analyze files

3. Plan implementation with think tool

4. Execute changes

5. Verify with think tool

</problem_patterns>

<tool_approaches>
Information Gathering Approaches

- Project Mapping: Build a mental model of the project structure

- Principles: Start broad → Focus on areas of interest → Dig deep into critical components
- Example: `directory_tree` for overview → `read_files` for key files → `search_content` for patterns → Custom analysis for understanding

- Code Pattern Analysis: Find patterns across the codebase

- Principles: Define search pattern → Filter to relevant scope → Process and analyze results
- Example: Search for API usage patterns with grep/search_content → Extract implementation details → Identify inconsistencies

- Dependency Tracing: Understand how components relate
- Principles: Start from entry points → Follow import/require statements → Map data flow → Identify coupling points
- Example: Analyze import statements → Map function calls → Track state management → Document component relationships

Modification Approaches

- Safe Transformation: Change code with confidence

- Principles: Understand before changing → Make minimal edits → Validate after each step → Preserve behavior
- Example: Read target files → Plan precise edits → Make changes incrementally → Run tests after each change

- Batch Updates: Apply consistent changes across many files

- Principles: Define pattern precisely → Validate on subset → Apply broadly → Verify results
- Example: Create and test change pattern → Identify affected files → Apply changes → Validate entire system

- Progressive Enhancement: Build functionality iteratively
- Principles: Start with minimal implementation → Test core behavior → Enhance incrementally → Refine based on feedback
- Example: Implement basic structure → Add core logic → Enhance with edge cases → Optimize performance

Validation Approaches

- Correctness Verification: Ensure changes meet requirements

- Principles: Define success criteria → Test against requirements → Verify edge cases → Confirm integration
- Example: Run existing tests → Add specific test cases → Verify integration points → Validate overall behavior

- Regression Detection: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- Principles: Establish baseline → Compare before/after → Focus on impact areas → Test boundary conditions
- Example: Run test suite before changes → Make targeted modifications → Rerun tests → Verify unchanged behavior

<think_example_1>
Error Handling Implementation Analysis
- Current error handling patterns:
* Inconsistent error response formats across modules
* Some operations missing try/except blocks
* Limited context in error messages
- Required improvements by operation:
* read_files: Add FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and encoding error handling
* write_file: Add PermissionError, IOError, and disk space validation
* edit_file: Add validation for empty oldText and proper error messages
- Implementation strategy:
1. Create consistent error response structure {status, message, details}
2. Add operation-specific try/except blocks with detailed context
3. Implement proactive validation before operations
4. Add logging with appropriate severity levels
- Integration approach:
* Update each function with minimal behavioral changes
* Add comprehensive tests for each error scenario
* Document error handling conventions
</think_example_1>

<think_example_2>
Feature Implementation Planning
- New project analysis feature requirements:
* Analyze dependency relationships across modules
* Identify potential circular dependencies
* Calculate code complexity metrics
* Generate visualization of module relationships
- Implementation considerations:
* Need to extend ProjectAnalyzer class
* Should reuse existing file traversal mechanisms
* Results need consistent format with other analyzer methods
* Must handle large codebases efficiently
- Design approach:
1. Create new DependencyAnalyzer class that follows existing analyzer patterns
2. Implement core dependency tracking algorithm
3. Add complexity calculation methods
4. Integrate visualization generation
5. Add caching for performance optimization
- Testing strategy:
* Unit tests for algorithm correctness
* Integration tests with existing analyzer components
* Performance tests with large codebases
</think_example_2>

<think_example_3>
Debugging Permission Error Analysis
- Error symptoms detailed:
* PermissionError only on certain path patterns
* Inconsistent behavior across OS environments
* Error frequency increases with path depth
- Hypothesis generation and evaluation:
1. Path normalization inconsistency - HIGH PROBABILITY
   * Different normalization between allowed_paths and requested paths
   * OS-specific path separator handling varies
2. Permission cache invalidation issue - MEDIUM PROBABILITY
   * Cache might not update when permissions change
   * Race condition possible during parallel operations
3. Environment variable interference - LOW PROBABILITY
   * User environment might override system paths
- Investigation approach:
* Trace path normalization across all code paths
* Test with normalized and non-normalized path variants
* Add debug logging to identify exact failure points
- Root cause identified:
* Path normalization uses os.path.normpath() in allowed_paths check
* But uses os.path.abspath() in file operations
* Leading to permission denied on symbolic links
- Solution strategy:
1. Standardize on os.path.realpath() for all path normalization
2. Add explicit path normalization before permission checks
3. Update tests to verify behavior with symlinks
4. Document path handling expectations
